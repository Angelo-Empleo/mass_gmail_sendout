# Description
This Python code can be used for automated mass email send-out. The code takes an Excel file containing a contact's name, email, and company name, and uses Gmail to send a personalized message. This code is run on a Macbook Pro, and therefore some functions (e.g. Keys) may have different syntax across Windows or Linux.
